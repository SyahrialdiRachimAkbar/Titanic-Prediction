    This application explores the famous Titanic dataset, which contains information about passengers aboard the RMS Titanic, 
    including whether they survived the tragic sinking on April 15, 1912.

    **Goal:** To analyze the factors influencing survival and build a machine learning model to predict if a passenger would survive based on their characteristics.

    **Dataset:** The dataset includes features like passenger class (Pclass), sex, age, fare paid, port of embarkation (Embarked), and family size.

    Use the sidebar to navigate through the different sections:
    *   **Exploratory Data Analysis:** Visualize patterns and insights from the data.
    *   **Model Performance:** See how well different machine learning models performed.
    *   **Make a Prediction:** Input passenger details to predict their survival chances using the best-performing model.

    *   **Pclass:** Passengers in 1st class had a much higher survival rate compared to 2nd and 3rd class passengers.
    *   **Age:** Younger passengers (children) had a higher chance of survival. There were many passengers in the 20-40 age range.
    *   **Fare:** Passengers who paid higher fares generally had better survival rates, likely correlated with Pclass.
    *   **Family Size:** Passengers traveling alone or with very large families had lower survival rates compared to those with small families (2-4 members).
    *   **Embarked:** Passengers embarking from Cherbourg (C) had a slightly higher survival rate.
